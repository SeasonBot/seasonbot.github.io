<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Santa Bot (AKA Boo Bot), a service provided by KerBots. Please read on to learn the rules and restrictions that govern your use of our website(s), products, services, proprietary bots, and other applications (the “Services”). If you have any questions, comments, or concerns regarding these terms or the Services, please contact us at <a href="https://discord.gg/8PpaAUwpFw" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/8PpaAUwpFw</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These Terms of Use (the “Terms”) are a binding contract between you and KerBots. (“KerBots”, “Ker”, “we” and “us”). Your use of the Services in any way means that you agree to all of these Terms, and these Terms will remain in effect while you use the Services. These Terms include the provisions in this document as well as those in the Privacy Policy and Copyright Dispute Policy. Your use of or participation in certain Services may also be subject to additional policies, rules and/or conditions (“Additional Terms”), which are incorporated herein by reference, and you understand and agree that by using or participating in any such Services, you agree to also comply with these Additional Terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please read these Terms carefully. They cover important information about Services provided to you. These Terms include information about future changes to these Terms, automatic renewals, limitations of liability, a class action waiver and resolution of disputes by arbitration instead of in court. PLEASE NOTE THAT YOUR USE OF AND ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES ARE SUBJECT TO THE FOLLOWING TERMS; IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE FOLLOWING, YOU MAY NOT USE OR ACCESS THE SERVICES IN ANY MANNER.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>ARBITRATION NOTICE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER: EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN THE ARBITRATION AGREEMENT SECTION BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND US WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li style="margin:0 0 0 24px;">Will these Terms ever change?
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services, so these Terms may need to change along with our Services. We reserve the right to change the Terms at any time, but if we do, we will place a notice on our server located at <a href="https://discord.gg/8PpaAUwpFw" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/8PpaAUwpFw</a>, send you an email, and/or notify you by some other means.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don’t agree with the new Terms, you are free to reject them; unfortunately, that means you will no longer be able to use the Services. If you use the Services in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Except for changes by us as described here, no other amendment or modification of these Terms will be effective unless in writing and signed by both you and us.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li style="margin:0 0 0 24px;">What about my privacy?
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KerBots takes the privacy of its users very seriously. For the current Privacy Policy, please click <a href="./explore.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li style="margin:0 0 0 24px;">Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) requires that online service providers obtain parental consent before they knowingly collect personally identifiable information online from children who are under thirteen (13). We do not knowingly collect or solicit personally identifiable information from children under sixteen (16); if you are a child under sixteen (16), please do not attempt to register for or otherwise use the Services or send us any personal information. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child under sixteen (16), we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under sixteen (16) may have provided us personal information, please contact us at <a href="https://discord.gg/8PpaAUwpFw" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/8PpaAUwpFw</a></p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li style="margin:0 0 0 24px;">What are the basics of using Santa Bot?
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may need to access certain parts or features of the Services (e.g. our proprietary bots) by using your account credentials and password from other services (“Third Party Account”), such as those offered by Discord. By using the Services through a Third Party Account, you permit us to access certain information from such account for use by the Services. You are ultimately in control of how much information is accessible to us and may exercise such control by adjusting your privacy settings on your Third Party Account. We store your account credentials but will not store your password. You promise to provide us with accurate, complete, and updated registration information about yourself. You may not use any Third Party Account that you do not have the right to use, or another person’s account credentials without authorization from that other person. You may not transfer your account to anyone else without our prior written permission.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that you are an individual of legal age to form a binding contract (or if not, you’ve received your parent’s or guardian’s permission to use the Services and have gotten your parent or guardian to agree to these Terms on your behalf). If you’re agreeing to these Terms on behalf of an organization or entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to agree to these Terms on that organization’s or entity’s behalf and bind them to these Terms (in which case, the references to “you” and “your” in these Terms, except for in this sentence, refer to that organization or entity).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your access to and use of the bots made available on our website are subject to additional end user license agreement. You will only use the Services for your own internal, personal, non-commercial use, and not on behalf of or for the benefit of any third party or any entity, and only in a manner that complies with all laws that apply to you. If your use of the Services is prohibited by applicable laws, then you aren’t authorized to use the Services. We can’t and won’t be responsible for your using the Services in a way that breaks the law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must protect the security of your Third Party Account credentials and password and any other access tools or credentials. You’re responsible for any activity associated with your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li style="margin:0 0 0 24px;">Are there restrictions in how I can use the Services?
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You represent, warrant, and agree that you will not contribute any Content or User Submission (each of those terms is defined below) or otherwise use the Services or interact with the Services in a manner that:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- infringes or violates the intellectual property rights or any other rights of anyone else (including KerBots);</p>
<p>- violates any law or regulation, including, without limitation, any applicable export control laws, privacy laws or any other purpose not reasonably intended by KerBots;</p>
<p>- is dangerous, harmful, fraudulent, deceptive, threatening, harassing, defamatory, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;</p>
<p>- jeopardizes the security of your account or anyone else’s (such as allowing someone else to log in to the Services as you);</p>
<p>- attempts, in any manner, to obtain the password, account, or other security information from any other user;</p>
<p>- violates the security of any computer network, or cracks any passwords or security encryption codes;</p>
<p>- runs Maillist, Listserv, any form of auto-responder or “spam” on the Services, or any processes that run or are activated while you are not logged into the Services, or that otherwise interfere with the proper working of the Services (including by placing an unreasonable load on the Services’ infrastructure);</p>
<p>- “crawls,” “scrapes,” or “spiders” any page, data, or portion of or relating to the Services or Content (through use of manual or automated means);</p>
<p>copies or stores any significant portion of the Content;</p>
<p>- decompiles, reverse engineers, or otherwise attempts to obtain the source code or underlying ideas or information of or relating to the Services; or</p>
<p>- you ask for a form of compensation directly to KerBots’ officers, directors, members, employees, consultants, contract employees, representatives and agents such as, but not limited to, money, personal information such as phone numbers, photos, addresses, or any other private information that may arise that could be compromised later.</p>
<p>A violation of any of the foregoing is grounds for termination of your right to use or access the Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li style="margin:0 0 0 24px;">What are my rights in the Services?
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The materials displayed or performed or available on or through the Services, including, but not limited to, text, graphics, data, articles, photos, images, illustrations, User Submissions (as defined below) and so forth (all of the foregoing, the “Content”) are protected by copyright and/or other intellectual property laws. You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell, commercialize or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including KerBots’) rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Subject to these Terms, we grant each user of the Services a worldwide, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable and non-transferable license to use (i.e., to download and display locally) Content solely for purposes of using the Services. Use, reproduction, modification, distribution or storage of any Content for any purpose other than using the Services is expressly prohibited without prior written permission from us. You understand that KerBots owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services. The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content, but please remember that even where these functionalities exist, all the restrictions in this section still apply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li style="margin:0 0 0 24px;">What about anything I contribute to the Services – do I have to grant any licenses to KerBots or to other users?
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li style="margin:0 0 0 24px;">User Submissions
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your “User Submission”. Some User Submissions may be viewable by other users. You are solely responsible for all User Submissions you contribute to the Services. You represent that all User Submissions submitted by you are accurate, complete, up-to-date, and in compliance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You agree that you will not post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services any User Submissions that: (i) infringe any third party's copyrights or other rights (e.g., trademark, privacy rights, etc.); (ii) contain sexually explicit content or pornography; (iii) contain hateful, defamatory, or discriminatory content or incite hatred against any individual or group; (iv) exploit minors; (v) depict unlawful acts or extreme violence; (vi) depict animal cruelty or extreme violence towards animals; (vii) promote fraudulent schemes, multi-level marketing (MLM) schemes, get rich quick schemes, online gaming and gambling, cash gifting, work from home businesses, or any other dubious money-making ventures; or (viii) that violate any law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li style="margin:0 0 0 24px;">Licenses
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions (see below for more information). Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By submitting User Submissions through the Services, you hereby do and shall grant KerBots a worldwide, non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable and transferable license to use, edit, modify, truncate, aggregate, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display, perform, and otherwise fully exploit the User Submissions in connection with this site, the Services and our (and our affiliates’, our and their respective successors’ and assigns’) businesses, including without limitation for promoting and redistributing part or all of this site or the Services (and derivative works thereof), including the User Submissions contained therein, in any media formats and through any media channels (including, without limitation, third party websites, social medias, and feeds), and including after your termination of your account or the Services. You also hereby do and shall grant each user of this site and/or the Services a non-exclusive, perpetual license to access your User Submissions through this site and/or the Services, and to use, edit, modify, reproduce, distribute, prepare derivative works of, display and perform such User Submissions, including after your termination of your account or the Services. For clarity, the foregoing license grants to us and our users do not affect your other ownership or license rights in your User Submissions, including the right to grant additional licenses to your User Submissions, unless otherwise agreed in writing. You represent and warrant that you have all rights to grant such licenses to us without infringement or violation of any third-party rights, including without limitation, any privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademarks, contract rights, or any other intellectual property or proprietary rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain features of the Services allow you to share information with others, including through your social networks or other services where you have an account (“Third Party Accounts”). When Content is authorized for sharing, we will clearly identify the Content you are authorized to redistribute and the ways you may redistribute it, usually by providing a “share” button on or near the Content. If you share information from the Services with others through your Third Party Accounts, such as your social networks, you authorize KerBots to share that information with the applicable Third Party Account provider. Please review the policies of any Third Party Account providers you share information with or through for additional information about how they may use your information. If you redistribute Content, you must be able to edit or delete any Content you redistribute, and you must edit or delete it promptly upon our request.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally, you understand and agree that KerBots, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include the rights to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li style="margin:0 0 0 24px;">What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers; to review our complete Copyright Dispute Policy and learn how to report potentially infringing content, <a href="./terms.html">click here</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li style="margin:0 0 0 24px;">Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any information or Content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated, and you access all such information and Content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or Content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Services may contain links or connections to third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by KerBots. When you access third-party websites or use third-party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that KerBots is not responsible for such risks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KerBots has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third-party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, KerBots will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third-party site or service. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third-party website or service that you visit or utilize. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website or service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that KerBots shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If there is a dispute between participants on this site or Services, or between users and any third party, you agree that KerBots is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release KerBots, its directors, officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. You shall and hereby do waive to Argentinian Laws or any similar law of any jurisdiction inside Argentina.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li style="margin:0 0 0 24px;">Will KerBots ever change the Services?
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We’re always trying to improve our Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. We reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li style="margin:0 0 0 24px;">Do the Services cost anything?
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Services is currently free for your personal and non-commercial use. If you’ll use the Services on behalf of any entity or any third party, please contact us for the enterprise customer license agreement. We reserve the right to require payment of fees for certain or all Services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
<li style="margin:0 0 0 24px;">What if I want to stop using the Services?
</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’re free to do that at any time by contacting us at <a href="https://discord.gg/8PpaAUwpFw" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/8PpaAUwpFw</a>; please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services. If you are an administrator, you may disconnect the Service from your server at any time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>KerBots is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. KerBots has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have deleted your account by mistake, contact us immediately – we will try to help, but unfortunately, we can’t promise that we can recover or restore anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Provisions that, by their nature, should survive termination of these Terms shall survive termination. By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us, including without limitation the arbitration agreement.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warranty Disclaimer. KerBots and its licensors, suppliers, partners, parent, subsidiaries or affiliated entities, and each of their respective officers, directors, members, employees, consultants, contract employees, representatives and agents, and each of their respective successors and assigns (KerBots and all such parties together, the “KerBots Parties”) make no representations or warranties concerning the Services, including without limitation regarding any Content contained in or accessed through the Services, and the KerBots Parties will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Services or any claims, actions, suits procedures, costs, expenses, damages or liabilities arising out of use of, or in any way related to your participation in, the Services. The KerBots Parties make no representations or warranties regarding suggestions or recommendations of services or products offered or purchased through or in connection with the Services. THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED BY KERBOTS&nbsp; (AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS) ON AN “AS-IS” BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR THAT USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE. SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Limitation of Liability. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY APPLICABLE LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, TORT, CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE) SHALL ANY OF THE KERBOTS PARTIES BE LIABLE TO YOU OR TO ANY OTHER PERSON FOR (A) ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, OR COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, (B) ANY SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY, (C) ANY AMOUNT, IN THE AGGREGATE, IN EXCESS OF THE GREATER OF (I) ONE-HUNDRED ($100) DOLLARS OR (II) THE AMOUNTS PAID AND/OR PAYABLE BY YOU TO KERBOTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICES IN THE TWO (2) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THIS APPLICABLE CLAIM OR (D) ANY MATTER BEYOND OUR REASONABLE CONTROL. SOME STATES IN ARGENTINA DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR CERTAIN OTHER DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indemnity. You agree to indemnify and hold the KerBots Parties harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages (actual and consequential), losses and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) arising from or in any way related to any claims relating to (a) your use of the Services (including any actions taken by a third party using your account), and (b) your violation of these Terms. In the event of such a claim, suit, or action (“Claim”), we will attempt to provide notice of the Claim to the contact information we have for your account (provided that failure to deliver such notice shall not eliminate or reduce your indemnification obligations hereunder).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assignment. You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without KerBots’ prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Choice of Law. These Terms are governed by and will be construed under the Leyes de Mediacion y Conciliacion, applicable federal law, and the laws of Argentina, without regard to the conflicts of laws provisions thereof.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arbitration Agreement. Please read the following ARBITRATION AGREEMENT carefully because it requires you to arbitrate certain disputes and claims with KerBots and limits the manner in which you can seek relief from KerBots. Both you and KerBots acknowledge and agree that for the purposes of any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms, KerBots’ officers, directors, employees and independent contractors (“Personnel”) are third-party beneficiaries of these Terms, and that upon your acceptance of these Terms, Personnel will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce these Terms against you as the third-party beneficiary hereof.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(a) Arbitration Rules; Applicability of Arbitration Agreement. The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms directly through good-faith negotiations, which shall be a precondition to either party initiating arbitration. If such negotiations do not resolve the dispute, it shall be finally settled by binding arbitration in Buenos Aires city, Argentina. The arbitration will proceed in the Spanish language, in accordance with the LEYES DE MEDIACION Y CONCILIACION Ley 26589 (the “Rules”) then in effect, by one commercial arbitrator with substantial experience in resolving intellectual property and commercial contract disputes. The arbitrator shall be selected from the appropriate list of&nbsp;Registro de Mediadores in accordance with such Rules. Judgment upon the award rendered by such arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(b) Costs of Arbitration. The Rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees. KerBots will pay all arbitration fees for claims less than Twenty-Thousand (20,000) ARS. KerBots will not seek its attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that your claim is frivolous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(c) Small Claims Court; Infringement. Either you or KerBots may assert claims, if they qualify, in small claims court in Buenos Aires City, Argentina. Furthermore, notwithstanding the foregoing obligation to arbitrate disputes, each party shall have the right to pursue injunctive or other equitable relief at any time, from any court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(d) Waiver of Jury Trial. YOU AND KERBOTS WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR JURY. You and KerBots are instead choosing to have claims and disputes resolved by arbitration. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient, and less costly than rules applicable in court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In any litigation between you and KerBots over whether to vacate or enforce an arbitration award, YOU AND KERBOTS WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, and elect instead to have the dispute be resolved by a judge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(e) Waiver of Class or Consolidated Actions. ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT MUST BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT ON A CLASS BASIS. CLAIMS OF MORE THAN ONE CUSTOMER OR USER CANNOT BE ARBITRATED OR LITIGATED JOINTLY OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER CUSTOMER OR USER. If, however, this waiver of class or consolidated actions is deemed invalid or unenforceable, neither you nor KerBots is entitled to arbitration; instead all claims and disputes will be resolved in a court as set forth in (g) below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(f) Opt-out. You have the right to opt out of the provisions of this Section by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to the following address: Gascon 384, CABA, Argentina 1181 postmarked within thirty (30) days of first accepting these Terms. You must include (i) your name and residence address, (ii) the email address and/or telephone number associated with your account, and (iii) a clear statement that you want to opt out of these Terms’ arbitration agreement. All costs of sending the written notice are made by you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(g) Exclusive Venue. If you send the opt-out notice in (f), and/or in any circumstances where the foregoing arbitration agreement permits either you or KerBots to litigate any dispute arising out of or relating to the subject matter of these Terms in court, then the foregoing arbitration agreement will not apply to either party, and both you and KerBots agree that any judicial proceeding (other than small claims actions) will be brought in the state or federal courts located in, respectively, Buenos Aires City, Argentina, or the federal district in which that county falls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(h) Severability. If the prohibition against class actions and other claims brought on behalf of third parties contained above is found to be unenforceable, then all of the preceding language in this Arbitration Agreement section will be null and void. This arbitration agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with KerBots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Miscellaneous. You will be responsible for paying for transportation, accomodation fees, withholding, filing, and reporting all taxes, duties, and other governmental assessments associated with your activity in connection with the Services, provided that the KerBots may, in its sole discretion, do any of the foregoing on your behalf or for itself as it sees fit. The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms are found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. You and KerBots agree that these Terms are the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding between you and KerBots, and that these Terms supersede and cancel all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of these Terms. You hereby acknowledge and agree that you are not an employee, agent, partner,&nbsp;associated, friend, or joint venture of KerBots, and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind KerBots in any respect whatsoever. We won't paid for anything stated above, and we are not liable for that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Except as expressly set forth in the section above regarding the arbitration agreement, you and KerBots agree there are no third-party beneficiaries intended under these Terms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When inviting our bot to you server and activating the Services, you confirm that you have read and accept all of these terms.</p>
